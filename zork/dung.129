		Flood Control Dam #3

  Flood Control Dam #3 (FCD#3) was constructed in year 783 of the
Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the
Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million
zorkmids from the Central Bureaucracy and your omnipotent local
tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive. This impressive
structure is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet
tall at the center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir
created behind the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an
area of 12 million square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand
feet.

  The construction of FCD#3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
the dedication. It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave
drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear
tree. The work was managed by a command team composed of 2345
bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of which can type),
12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape
processors, and nearly one million dead trees.

  We will now point out some of the more interesting features
of FCD#3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities:

    When an error is encountered in this version, you will be asked
for a description of the problem immediately, just as if you had used
the 'bug' command.  We hope that this will improve the handling of
such problems.

    A reminder that save files created before 1/17 will not work in
this version; fortunately, the program is clever enough to figure out
whether a particular save file can be used or not.

    New commands 'bug' and 'feature' (with various synonyms) have
been added.  They cause a file to be written out; it is hoped that
such files will eventually be directed to the maintainers.

    In addition to 'take foo and bar', the parser now claims to
understand things like 'take foo and read bar', 'take foo and read
it', and so on.

"			WELCOME TO DUNGEON

    DUNGEON is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by
mortal man. Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors
contained within!

    In DUNGEON the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten
secrets of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth,
searching for vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures
guarded by fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

    No PDP-10 should be without one!

    DUNGEON was created at the Programming Technology Division of the
MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank,
Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the ADVENTURE
game of Crowther and Woods, and Dungeons and Dragons, by Gygax and
Arneson.  DUNGEON is written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).

    On-line information may be available using the HELP and INFO
commands (most systems).

Mr. TAA of Muddle, Mass. says: \"Before I took this course I used
to be a lowly bit twiddler.  Now with what I learned at MIT Tech
I feel really important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best.\"

Mr. MARC had this to say: \"Ten short days ago all I could look

MIT Tech can't promise these fantastic results to everyone.  But when

"The engravings were incised in the living rock of the cave wall by
an unknown hand.  They depict, in symbolic form, the beliefs of the
ancient peoples of Zork.  Skillfully interwoven with the bas reliefs
are excerpts illustrating the major tenets expounded by the sacred
texts of the religion of that time.  Unfortunately a later age seems
to have considered them blasphemous and just as skillfully excised
them.">

"The prayer is inscribed in an ancient script which is hardly
remembered these days, much less understood.  What little of it can
be made out seems to be a phillipic against small insects,
absent-mindedness, and the picking up and dropping of small objects. 
The final verse seems to consign trespassers to the land of the
dead.  All evidence indicates that the beliefs of the ancient
Zorkers were obscure.">
