# Zork source code, 1978 January
This repository contains the source code for a January 1978 version of [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork), an interactive fiction game created at MIT by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling. The files are a part of the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Tapes of Tech Square (ToTS) collection](https://archivesspace.mit.edu/repositories/2/resources/1265) at the MIT Libraries Department of Distinctive Collections (DDC).
## File organization and details
### [zork](../main/zork)
The files within this directory are the Zork specific files from the ```9005201.tap``` tape image file within the ```/tots/recovered/vol2``` directory of the [ToTS collection](https://archivesspace.mit.edu/repositories/2/resources/1265). Most files are written in the MDL programming language and were originally created on a PDP-10 timeshare computer running the ITS operating system.

The files were extracted from the tape image using the [itstar program](https://github.com/PDP-10/itstar). The filenames have been adapted to Unix conventions, as per the itstar translation. The original filename syntax would be formatted like, ```LCF; ACT1 71```, for example. All files have been placed into this artificial zork directory for organizational purposes.

The [```ar1.random```](../main/zork/```ar1.random```) directory contains the extracted files from the ```ar1.random``` file within the [```taa```](../main/zork/taa) directory. The [```dungon.11```](../main/zork/ar1.random/dungon.11) and [```zork.3```](../main/zork/ar1.random/zork.3) files are the source code to the [```ts.zork```](../main/zork/sys2/ts.zork) file. The files were extracted recently and added to this directory by DDC digital archivist, Joe Carrano, for researcher ease of access.

The [```lcf```](../main/zork/lcf) and [```madman```](../main/zork/madman) directories contain the source code for the game.

The [```sys2```](../main/zork/sys2) directory contains the program used to start the game, ```ts.zork```.

The [```taa```](../main/zork/taa) directory contains multiple copies of an ```ar1.random``` file, which is an ITS archive file (similar to a ZIP file). The extracted files can be found in the [```ar1.random```](../main/zork/ar1.random) directory.

The files outside of these subdirectories, such as [```act1.71```](../main/zork/act1.71), etc., are the decrypted versions of files found in the [```lcf```](../main/zork/lcf) directory. The decrypted versions were created recently and added to this directory by DDC digital archivist, Joe Carrano, for researcher ease of access.  

Files with extensions ```.nbin``` and ```.save``` are binary compiled files.

There was a ```zork.log``` file within the [```madman```](../main/zork/madman) directory that detailed who played Zork at the time of creation. DDC excluded this file from public release to protect the privacy of those named.
